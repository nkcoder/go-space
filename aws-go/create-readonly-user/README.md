## What 

Create a readonly user on AWS:

1. Create a readonly group if it doesn't exist.

2. Attach the `readonly` access to the group.

3. Create a new user and add the user to the readonly group.

## Why

My manager asks me to configure a readonly account for him in our `dev` AWS account. 

**DON'T destroy, otherwise the user will be deleted from AWS**
